									<h2><a href=#>Introductions are in order.</a></h2>
<p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">Welcome to my website!<br />
As you can see, there's plenty of natural light, a real killer kitchenette, and over there is the all-so-important reading nook.<br />
We're looking for a 12% down payment from interested parties and-<br />
What's that?<br />
You're not here to listen to my long winded realtor analogies?<br />
You're here to learn about Aubrey Kjellander?<br />
Well, consider me flattered.<br /><br />
										
As you may have gathered, I am the titular Aubrey Kjellander, a graduate of Becker College who brandishes a Bachelor's degree in Interactive Media and Design (with a Minor in Psychology).<br />
During college I worked on multiple game projects as writing lead, design lead, and project manager.<br />
Junior year I was given an internship at Fidelity Investments where I managed a team of game developers working on a financial literacy project.<br />
Following my graduation during the 2020 worldwide pandemic, I worked multiple odd jobs and produced a litany of unpublished art and writing projects until I was hired as the Lead Game Designer at the Ed-Tech company, Objective Ed, where I have been working ever since.<br />
It's been almost 6 years since I was first hired, and since then I have pivoted from my position as Lead Game Designer, and taken on the roll of Project Manager.<br />
Depending on the project, my tasks will vary between drafting design documents, generating UI wireframes, holding team stand ups, providing market research for our writing team, or even negotiating grant deadlines and funds. <br />
I also allocate assets, provided Quality Assurance testing, reworked new mechanics as requested, and work to maintain consistent communication across all our development departments.<br />

One important factor to note, is ObjectiveEd's main demographic. The games and interactive tools we produce are educational experiences aimed to aid students with disabilities, though currently our suite of games is aimed mainly at students who are Blind or who have Low Vision.<br />
Beyond my Minor in Psychology, I had little background working with such topics, so my first year at Objective Ed involved a lot of research on Accessibility in Education and Technology. Not only that, but as our company grew, I was given more and more responsibilities.<br />
Alongside Designing our products, I was also testing them, acquiring their assets, and scheduling all of our company's product meetings both in-house and with experts who were willing to provide insight into the topics we aimed to tackle in our games.<br />
It was a lot to take on so suddenly, but it was also an incredible learning experience.<br />
It was through the hours of coding, designing, writing, communicating, and organizing that I unknowingly adopted the role of Project Manager and fell in love with the position!<br /><br />
	
Since then, Objective Ed has produced over 15 different Educational Interactive Fiction stories focused on teaching developmental skills to BLV and Autistic youths (Some of which I wrote, coded, and edited myself).<br />
I've also designed over thirty individual games and teaching programs for ObjectiveEd, all on the IOS platform. Most of which were developed simultaneously alongside our Interactive Fiction games.<br />
I've onboarded additional emlpoyees, catching them up to speed on our development process, the details of the grants they'll be writing for, and teaching them the programming language that we use for our IF games.<br />
I've organized expert teams, scheduled discussions with Grant Holders, and held weekly meetings with all involved parties in an effort to maintain communication and clarity of product trajectory.<br /><br />

My work at Objective Ed has taught me a lot, and also helped me realize that I want to do more!<br />
I'm ready to tackle bigger and better projects, and help direct industry shaking, trend-breaking, wholly unique, human-driven projects with a mindfulness for accessibile needs and a mind overflowing with ideas.<br /><br />

I'm a Lead Designer, Lead Writer, Project Manager, QA Tester, Artist, Audio Designer, Video Editor, and all around nice guy.<br />
In my free time I enjoy writing short stories, designing character concepts, editing videos, 3D modeling, drawing, worldbuilding, developing environmental textures, and spending WAY too much time organizing my various Dungeons and Dragons Campaigns.<br />
I'm a skilled storyboard artist, a decent cook, and an exceptionally hard worker.<br />
I love cheesy 80's horror practical effects, 90's manga, and I am a collector of card games from various different eras.
Out of everything, there's really only two things I'm missing.<br />
Your job offer, and a really big sandwich.<br /><br />
										
So, which one are you here to offer?</p>

									<h2><a href=>A creative mind.</a></h2>
									<p>Welcome to my website! Allow me to show you around. 
										There's plenty of natural light, a real killer kitchenette, and over there is the all-so-important breakfast nook.
										The seller is looking for a 10% down payment from interested parties and-
										What's that?
										You're not here to listen to my long winded realtor metaphors?
										You're here to talk about me?
										Well, consider me flattered. 
										
										My name is Aubrey Kjellander and I am a graduate of Becker College but, luckily, that's not all. 
										I hold a degree in Interactive Media and Design with a Minor in Psychology.
										During college I worked on multiple game projects as writing lead, design lead, and even project management lead.
										Junior year I was given an internship at Fidelity Investments where I managed a team of game developers working on a financial literacy project.
										Following my graduation during the 2020 worldwide pandemic, I worked multiple odd jobs and produced a litany of unpublished art and writing projects.
										In 2021 I was hired as the full-time Lead Game Designer at the Ed-Tech company, Objective Ed, where I have been working ever since; although my position has changed quite drastically over the years.
										Starting out, I worked on redesigning multiple games that Objective Ed had already developed. Initially it was my job to take a mechanically complete project and inject it with fun and engaging factors that'd keep our users invested and attentive.
										From there I designed entire games, including mechanics. I was presented with a concept like, "Speed Reading" and was given 3 days to produce a functionally complete Design Document, Wireframe, and presentation.
										As games were being developed, I allocated assets, provided Quality Assurance testing, reworked new mechanics into the design, and worked to maintain consistent communication across all departments.
										One thing I neglected to mention is our company's main demographic. The games we are producing are for students who are Blind or who have Low Vision.
										I have no background with such topics, so my first year at Objective Ed involved a lot of research on Accessibility in Education and Technology.
										Coming up on my second year, Objective Ed began taking on Grant work, as most start-up companies tend to do.
										Because of this, our projects exploded in scope, and we needed to restructure the agile development strategies we had been using.
										I was given the additional title of Project Manager, and put in charge of organizing and directing meetings our company held between departments and with teams of experts we used as consultants.
										So, alongside Designing our products, I was also testing them, acquiring their assets, and scheduling all of our company's product meetings.
										Needless to say, things didn't go well.
										You might be shocked to hear me admit this, but it's the truth. 
										I struggled to maintain the balance of the many unwieldy hats I had been given to wear.
										I think anyone in my position would have, though maybe not as much as I did.
										However, I find that skills are often best forged when one undergoes a trial by fire.
										Following the completion of our first grant project, and my second year of employment, Objective Ed really started to branch out.
										Since then we have produced 2 Interactive Fiction stories focused on taking BLV and Autistic youths through the process of acquiring and working summer jobs.
										I was the lead writer on the latter project where I had to manage time between it and a second project we had recently accepted from the Canadian National Institute for the Blind.
										At present I work as the Project Manager for 3 Interactive Fiction games that are being produced simultaneously, of which I am also the Lead Writer and UI Designer.
										I have also onboarded 2 new writers Objective Ed has hired, catching them up to speed on our development process, the details of the grants they'll be writing for, and teaching them the Inkle programming language that we use for our IF games.
										I do this all while organizing three separate teams of experts. I manage the accessibility and development questions our writing and development teams have, and present them in weekly meetings that I schedule and direct.
										All of this Interactive Fiction work is done alongside the continuing CNIB project I previously mentioned which has been in development for over a year.
										In the CNIB project I have designed over thirty individual games and teaching programs for IOS, organized expert teams, scheduled discussions with Grant Holders, and held weekly meetings with all involved parties in an effort to maintain communication and clarity of product trajectory.
										I've learned programming languages, agile methodology, Accessibility design flow, project management tactics, IOS UI design trends, Unity Development flow, and so many other things.
										I'm a Lead Designer, Lead Writer, Project Manager, QA Tester, Artist, Audio Designer, Video Editor, and all around nice guy.
										In my free time I enjoy writing short stories, designing character concepts, editing videos, 3D modeling, developing environmental textures, and spending WAY too much time organizing my various Dungeons and Dragons Campaigns.
										I am an skilled storyboard artist, a decent cook, and an exceptionally hard worker.
										Out of everything, there's really only two things I'm missing.
										Your job, and a breakfast nook.
										
										So, looking to make a down payment?
